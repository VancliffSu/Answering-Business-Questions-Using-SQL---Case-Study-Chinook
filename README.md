# Answering-Business-Questions-Using-SQL---Case-Study-Chinook

This project is a part of the Dataquest guided project. I did some further analysis and visulization on my own. In this project, we will explore a modified version of the Chinook database utilizing SQL and answer some business-related questions. The Chinook database represents a fictional digital media shop, based on real data from an iTunes Library and manually generated data. The database is provided as a SQLite database file called chinook.db.
